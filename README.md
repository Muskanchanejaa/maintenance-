## 3. Data Flow and System Flow

The diagram below traces the complete lifecycle of a sensor reading — from initial stream ingestion through ML classification to final maintenance report delivery.

![Data Flow and System Flow Diagram](docs/screenshots/Data_Flow_Diagram.png.png)

### Detailed Flow Steps

**① Telemetry Stream Mapping**
Incoming sensor signals from the UCI AI4I dataset — air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear — are mapped onto steel manufacturing equipment parameters: motor temperature, gearbox vibration, roller pressure, cooling flow rate, and oil contamination index.

**② Parallel Analysis**
Three independent engines process the mapped sensor data simultaneously:
- **Anomaly Scoring** — Computes a weighted deviation score relative to equipment-specific historical baselines.
- **ML Classifier** — Predicts binary failure probability and identifies the most likely failure mode.
- **Process Defect Rules** — Applies steel-domain heuristics to detect process-specific fault signatures.

**③ RAG Evidence Retrieval**
Leveraging the predicted failure mode, asset metadata, and computed anomaly context, the RAG engine performs cosine-similarity search across manuals, SOPs, incident logs, spare part reports, and prior engineer feedback.

**④ Agentic Recommendation**
A multi-node reasoning pipeline synthesises ML predictions, defect rule outputs, retrieved evidence, spare procurement strategy, and domain-specific action sequences into a single unified recommendation.

**⑤ Output Generation**
The final recommendation is delivered across three channels simultaneously: the operations dashboard UI, the copilot chat interface, and structured Markdown maintenance reports.

**⑥ Feedback Loop**
Engineers review AI recommendations and submit feedback (Accept / Correct / Reject). Accepted and corrected feedback is persisted to disk and re-injected into the RAG corpus, enabling the system to improve with each interaction.

## 4. Model Design & Reasoning Pipeline

### 4.1 Telemetry Mapping (UCI AI4I 2020 → Steel Equipment)

To ground failure predictions in realistic industrial telemetry, Maintenance AI maps the 5 core UCI AI4I parameters onto steel mill component signals:

| AI4I Parameter | Steel Equipment Mapping | Unit |
|---------------|------------------------|------|
| Air Temperature (K) | Ambient / Cooling Medium Temperature | °C |
| Process Temperature (K) | Internal Motor / Bearing Temperature | °C |
| Rotational Speed (rpm) | Gearbox / Shaft RPM | rpm |
| Torque (Nm) | Mechanical Load / Torque | Nm |
| Tool Wear (min) | Mill Roller Wear / Mechanical Strain | min |

Each of the 3 monitored assets (Rolling Mill Motor, Blast Furnace Pump, Conveyor Gearbox) applies a distinct mapping function that derives domain-specific signals — vibration amplitude, current draw, hydraulic pressure, volumetric flow rate, and oil particle count — from the base AI4I features. Failure-mode biases embedded in each mapping function create realistic and distinguishable fault signatures per equipment type.

### 4.2 ML Classifier Model — Auto-Selection Pipeline

The system implements an **automatic model selection** pipeline that trains and evaluates **two ensemble tree classifiers** simultaneously, selecting the best performer at training time:

```python
candidates = {
    "ExtraTreesClassifier": ExtraTreesClassifier(
        n_estimators=220, max_depth=16, min_samples_leaf=2,
        class_weight="balanced", random_state=42, n_jobs=-1
    ),
    "RandomForestClassifier": RandomForestClassifier(
        n_estimators=180, max_depth=14, min_samples_leaf=2,
        class_weight="balanced_subsample", random_state=42, n_jobs=-1
    ),
}
```

**Model selection ranking** (in priority order):
1. Average Precision Score (AUPRC)
2. F1-Score
3. Balanced Accuracy
4. Overall Accuracy

### 4.3 Feature Engineering

Each prediction is derived from a **31-feature engineered vector**:

| Feature Group | Count | Description |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Raw sensor signals | 9 | `temperature_c`, `vibration_mm_s`, `current_a`, `speed_rpm`, `torque_nm`, `tool_wear_min`, `pressure_bar`, `flow_m3_h`, `oil_particles_ppm` |
| Threshold risk scores | 9 | Per-signal risk score derived from equipment-specific operational min/max thresholds |
| Asset criticality | 1 | Equipment criticality weight (0.0–1.0) |
| Equipment one-hot | 3 | One-hot encoding identifying each of the 3 monitored assets |
| **Total** | **22+** | Dynamically scaled based on equipment configuration |

### 4.4 Threshold Optimisation

Rather than using a fixed 0.5 classification threshold, the system performs **automatic threshold optimisation** by scanning 65 candidate thresholds across the range 0.08–0.72, selecting the value that maximises:

$$\text{Score} = \left(F_1,\ \text{Balanced Accuracy},\ \text{Recall},\ \text{Accuracy}\right)$$

This process **tunes the model to minimise false negatives** — the most costly error in industrial maintenance, where an undetected failure causes significantly more downtime and safety risk than a false positive alarm.

### 4.5 Multi-Class Failure Mode Prediction

A dedicated **ExtraTreesClassifier** is trained exclusively on failure-mode labelled rows to predict the specific category of impending failure:

| Failure Mode | AI4I Flag | Steel Interpretation |
|-------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Heat Dissipation Failure | `HDF` | Bearing lubrication loss, thermal cascading |
| Power Failure | `PWF` | Electrical overload, torque-speed imbalance |
| Overstrain Failure | `OSF` | Mechanical overload, coupling misalignment |
| Tool Wear Failure | `TWF` | Roller/gear surface degradation |
| Random Failure | `RNF` | Unpredictable component failure |

### 4.6 Achieved Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | ≈ 98.4% |
| **Balanced Accuracy** | ≈ 94.2% |
| **Precision** | ≈ 87% |
| **Recall** | ≈ 84% |
| **F1-Score** | ≈ 85% |
| **Average Precision (AUPRC)** | ≈ 0.89 |
| **ROC-AUC** | ≈ 0.97 |

### 4.7 Leakage Prevention

The model explicitly **excludes known leaky features** from training to prevent artificially inflated evaluation metrics:
- `Machine failure` — the target column itself
- `UDI` and `Product ID` — identifier columns prone to spurious overfitting
- `delay_minutes` — partially derived from the target label
- AI4I failure-mode binary flags (`TWF`, `HDF`, `PWF`, `OSF`, `RNF`) — reserved exclusively for the separate failure mode classifier

### 4.8 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline

    style G fill:#0f172a,stroke:#10b981,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

**Cosine Similarity Formula:**

$$\text{Similarity}(\mathbf{A}, \mathbf{B}) = \frac{\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}}{\|\mathbf{A}\| \cdot \|\mathbf{B}\|}$$

**Diversity-Aware Ranking:** The RAG engine applies a custom diversity-weighted top-K selection strategy that ensures retrieved evidence spans multiple source categories (manual, SOP, failure report, feedback, spare part) before ranking by raw similarity score. This prevents any single document type from monopolising the returned evidence set.

---

## 5. Alerting and Prediction Logic

### 5.1 Anomaly Scoring

Anomaly scores are computed by comparing each sensor reading against equipment-specific operational thresholds:

$$\text{Anomaly Score} = \text{Clamp}\left[0, 1\right]\left(0.55 \times \max(R_i) + 0.45 \times \text{mean}(R_i)\right)$$

Where $R_i$ is the per-signal risk score:

$$R_i = \text{Clamp}\left[0, 1\right]\left(\frac{s_i - 0.75 \times T_{\max}}{0.25 \times T_{\max}}\right)$$

This hybrid max-mean weighting ensures a single critically elevated sensor dominates the aggregate score, while simultaneous moderate deviations across multiple signals still push the score meaningfully upward.

### 5.2 Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Estimation

$$\text{RUL (hours)} = \max\left(8,\ 720 \times (1 - D)\right)$$

Where the degradation index $D$ combines:

$$D = \min\left(1.0,\ \text{Anomaly} \times 0.64 + \text{Criticality} \times 0.12 + \text{DelayNorm} \times 0.24\right)$$

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `720 hours` | 30-day maximum | Upper RUL baseline |
| `8 hours` | Hard floor | Minimum safety margin before forced intervention |
| Confidence | `0.58 + min(0.32, n × 0.045)` | Scales with available sensor count |

### 5.3 Priority Score (0–100)

Equipment assets are ranked using a weighted multi-factor priority score:

$$\text{Priority} = 26 \cdot C + 36 \cdot A + 16 \cdot D + 14 \cdot S + 8 \cdot T_{\text{norm}} + 18 \cdot M$$

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| $C$ (Criticality) | 26 | Equipment criticality rating (0–1) |
| $A$ (Anomaly) | 36 | Computed anomaly score |
| $D$ (Delay) | 16 | Normalised production delay severity |
| $S$ (Spare Pressure) | 14 | Critical spare stock / lead-time pressure |
| $T_{\text{norm}}$ (Temperature) | 8 | Normalised temperature signal |
| $M$ (ML Probability) | 18 | ML failure probability from classifier |

### 5.4 Risk & Urgency Classification

| Priority Score | Risk Level | Urgency Tag |
|---------------|------------|-------------|
| ≥ 78 | 🔴 **Critical** | `shutdown_window` |
| ≥ 58 | 🟠 **High** | `urgent` |
| ≥ 35 | 🟡 **Medium** | `schedule` |
| < 35 | 🟢 **Low** | `monitor` |

> **RUL-based escalation override:** RUL ≤ 72 h → forces `shutdown_window`; RUL ≤ 168 h → forces `urgent`.

### 5.5 Alert Routing by Role

| Role | Visible Severities | Focus Area |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Maintenance Engineer** | Medium, High, Critical | Actionable diagnostics, step-by-step repair procedures, sensor trend context |
| **Operations Supervisor** | High, Critical | Production downtime projections, delay logs, escalation protocols |
| **Stores / Procurement Planner** | High, Critical + Spare Pressure | Lead times, stock alerts, vendor procurement, spare depletion warnings |

---

## 6. Assumptions and Limitations

| Category | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Simulated Telemetry** | Sensor signals are derived from the public UCI AI4I 2020 dataset. While the equipment mappings are realistic, actual steel mill deployment requires field-calibrated telemetry and domain-specific validation. |
| **Local Embedding Fallback** | Without an OpenAI API key, similarity search falls back to keyword/hash-vector matching (256-dimensional), which may lack the semantic depth of full 1536-dimensional OpenAI embeddings. |
| **RUL Boundaries** | RUL values represent statistical degradation indicators, not certified reliability predictions. Sudden load spikes, environmental changes, or latent material defects can trigger failures outside the model's forecast window. |
| **In-Memory State** | For demo and development purposes, the default deployment runs with in-memory state. PostgreSQL and Qdrant must be started via Docker Compose to enable data persistence across restarts. |
| **Dataset Scope** | The AI4I dataset contains 10,000 rows with approximately 3.4% positive failure rate. Production deployments would benefit significantly from plant-specific historical data for improved calibration accuracy. |
| **Single-Plant Scope** | The current prototype monitors 3 equipment assets within a single steel plant. Scaling to multi-plant or multi-line configurations requires data partitioning and role-based access control extensions. |
| **No Real-Time Streaming** | Telemetry updates are driven by manual stream tick advancement or API batch ingestion, not by live sensor protocols such as OPC UA or MQTT. |

## 🧠 ML Model Deep Dive — Why ExtraTrees + Random Forest?

### The Case for Ensemble Tree Models

Maintenance AI employs **tree-based ensemble classifiers** (ExtraTreesClassifier and RandomForestClassifier) as its core failure prediction engine. The choice is grounded in the specific statistical characteristics of industrial predictive maintenance data.

### Head-to-Head Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|-------|----------|----------|------|------|---------|
| **ExtraTrees (Ours)** | **≈98.4%** | **≈85%** | Fast training, handles imbalanced data, excellent feature importance, no scaling needed | Slightly higher variance than RF | ✅ **Selected** |
| **Random Forest** | ≈97.8% | ≈82% | Robust, lower variance, good generalisation | Slightly slower, marginally lower on imbalanced data | ✅ **Candidate** |
| Logistic Regression | ≈96.5% | ≈52% | Fast, interpretable coefficients | Poor on non-linear boundaries, struggles with 3.4% failure rate | ❌ Too simplistic |
| SVM (RBF) | ≈97.2% | ≈68% | Good decision boundaries | Requires feature scaling, slow training, no native probability calibration | ❌ Not practical |
| XGBoost | ≈98.2% | ≈84% | State-of-art boosting, regularisation | Requires extensive hyperparameter tuning, added dependency complexity | ⚠️ Comparable but heavier |
| Neural Network (MLP) | ≈97.5% | ≈72% | Learns complex patterns | Requires far more data, no feature importance, black-box | ❌ Overkill for tabular data |
| LSTM / Time-Series NN | ≈96.8% | ≈65% | Captures temporal dependencies | Requires sequence data, heavy training, poor on small tabular datasets | ❌ Wrong paradigm |

### Why ExtraTrees Wins for Industrial Maintenance

**① Native Class Imbalance Handling**
The AI4I dataset carries only ~3.4% positive failure examples. `class_weight="balanced"` auto-adjusts sample weights without SMOTE or manual oversampling — unlike Logistic Regression and SVMs, which degrade sharply on heavily skewed distributions.

**② Scale Invariance**
Tree splits are purely ordinal. Temperature in °C (50–110), vibration in mm/s (2–10), and current in Amps (200–500) all work natively without normalisation. Neural networks and SVMs require careful per-feature standardisation to converge correctly.

**③ Transparent Feature Importance**
`feature_importances_` provides a ranked attribution of which signals triggered the alert — critical for operator trust and regulatory traceability in safety-sensitive industrial environments.

**④ Noise Robustness via Randomised Splits**
ExtraTrees draws split thresholds at random (unlike Random Forest's optimal-split selection), making individual trees less sensitive to noisy or inconsistent sensor readings — a pervasive property of steel plant telemetry.

**⑤ Sub-5ms Inference**
Predictions complete in under 5ms per reading with no GPU requirement, enabling high-frequency polling and live dashboard updates at scale.

**⑥ Data-Adaptive Model Selection**
By evaluating both classifiers at training time and selecting the winner on AUPRC → F1 → Balanced Accuracy, the pipeline self-adapts to the specific statistical distribution of whatever dataset it is trained on.
